This project is a website that will act as the main tourism hub needed to visit anything in Egypt. It will allow the tourist to pick their trips based on 3 categories, either a location to visit alone, a whole day package with a certain program , a whole week package (with the ability to include transportation and accommodation) and even they will be able to create their own package with some limitations. The website will operate through a structured role-based system to ensure smooth management and clear responsibilities. At the top level, the Admin has full control over the entire platform, with unlimited access to edit and manage all sections of the website, including travel packages, hotels, transportation services, tourist guides, employees, and customer accounts. The admin can also monitor analytics and generate reports to track performance and user activity. Under the admin, there are several types of employees, each with specific responsibilities. The Planner manages pricing and updates or creates travel packages. The Booking Manager is responsible for confirming user bookings and custom trips. Tourist Guides can manage their availability calendars and specify the languages they speak, while Customer Support handles user inquiries and complaints and can escalate issues to the admin when necessary. In addition, Hotel Managers are responsible for managing room availability and confirming hotel reservations, and the Transportation role oversees available vehicles or transport services, confirms availability, and finalizes transportation bookings. Finally, the User can register on the platform, choose from existing travel packages or create a fully customized trip, and leave reviews for tourist guides, transportation services, and hotels based on their experience.
